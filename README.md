# Rubik-sCubeHW1
Image Processing HW1

The Homework is about the followings:

The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle on which each of the six faces was covered by nine stickers, each of one of six
solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow.
a) Write a GUI that imports Rubik's Cube images from 5 different view points under different light conditions.
b) Enable to select 12 pixels via mouse cursor for 2 pixels per color at different surfaces from each image and analyze the pixel values.
c) Change color space from RGB to HSI and repeat the process asked in b.

Solution Procedure:
Using OpenCV the conversion issue is going to be solved easily.
As for the GUI a simple Tkinter code is going to be written Since I'm facing issues Downloading PyQT designer.
